# Fibril-Analysis-for-Cellulose-Technology-FACT-
An image analysis framework, Fibril Analysis for Cellulose Technology (FACT), which utilizes machine learning (ML) segmentation and morphological thinning, to measure the fibril width distribution of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) from negative contrast scanning electron microscopy (NegC-SEM) images. This application was developed in Mathematica V13.
